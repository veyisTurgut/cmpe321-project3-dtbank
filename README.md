* We built and tested the application on Mac/Ubuntu.
* We used FastAPI for backend, Vue.js for frontend and PostgreSQL for database. 

## HOW TO RUN
* Create a virtual environment: `virtualenv myenv`
* Activate the virtual environment: `source myenv/bin/activate`
* Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Set up a postgresql database
* Run database initializer to setup database: `python3 database_initializer.py`
  * We used these credentials for logging in to database, we guess these are the default settings:
  ```python
  {"dbname= dtbank user= postgres host=localhost password=5432 port=5432"}
  ```
* Run the backend application: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
* Open a different terminal and enter frontend folder: `cd frontend`
* Install necessary requirements for frontend: `npm install`
  * If you don't have npm installed, follow this link: [https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* Run the frontend application: `npm run dev`
* Congrats! Now you can use the application.

* Now, you can access the features of DTBank.

and its corresponding entries from SIDER and BindingDB.

   * See trigger delete_drug_related_reaction which executes procedure delete_reaction_by_drug

(b) When a protein is deleted, its corresponding entries from BindingDB should be removed.
   * See trigger delete_protein_related_rows which executes procedure delete_rows_with_uniprot_id
   * See trigger delete_protein_related_reaction which executes procedure delete_reaction_by_protein

(c) When a new publication is added to the system, the corresponding institute gets 5 points for a new publication and gets 2 points for each individual who contributed to it. Also, when there is an update on the publication that changes the number of contributors, update the corresponding instituteâ€™s score accordingly.
   * See trigger insert_institutions which executes procedure insert_institutions
   * See trigger article_points which executes procedure increase_institution_points
